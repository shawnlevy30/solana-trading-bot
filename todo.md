# Solana Memecoin Trading Bot Development Todo List

## Project Setup
- [x] Read and analyze project requirements
- [x] Create project directory structure
- [x] Set up version control
- [x] Install required dependencies and libraries
- [x] Review additional context document

## 1. Data Collection System
- [ ] Develop new data collection system from scratch (existing system is obsolete)
- [ ] Research and select appropriate APIs (Dexscreener, Birdeye, GeckoTerminal)
- [ ] Implement API connectors for historical data retrieval
- [ ] Implement real-time data streaming
- [ ] Implement timeframe adaptability based on coin age and market cap
- [ ] Create data pipeline for critical data points:
  - [ ] Price and volume (standard candle data)
  - [ ] Holder information and distribution
  - [ ] Technical indicators
  - [ ] DEX metrics (paid/boost/ads status)
  - [ ] Twitter sentiment and mention metrics
- [ ] Streamline data collection process to reduce manual effort
- [ ] Implement data storage and caching system
- [ ] Test data collection with sample memecoin tokens

## 2. Custom Filters for Coin Selection
- [ ] Develop filters to replace telegram call channels (target >60% success rate)
- [ ] Implement orderblock analysis system:
  - [ ] Identify significant pump zones
  - [ ] Locate last set of red candles prior to pump
  - [ ] Create rectangle from highest red wick to lowest red wick
  - [ ] Monitor price action when it enters this zone for bullish signals
- [ ] Create visualization and alert system for orderblock zones
- [ ] Implement social media indicator filters:
  - [ ] Mentions by respected influencers
  - [ ] Contract address mention frequency
  - [ ] Viral meme content detection
- [ ] Develop volume analysis filters:
  - [ ] Volume spike detection (e.g., 65% increase)
  - [ ] Volume threshold conditions
  - [ ] Volume/MC ratio analysis
- [ ] Create market ratio filters:
  - [ ] Market Cap/Volume
  - [ ] Market Cap/Volume Spike
  - [ ] Market Cap/Number of Holders

## 3. Security Audit System
- [ ] Implement automated security checks for red flags:
  - [ ] Non-pump.fun token detection
  - [ ] High concentration metrics (bundles, snipers, top holders >30%)
  - [ ] Large green first candle detection
  - [ ] Bot-fabricated chart detection
  - [ ] All-time high price detection
- [ ] Optimize security check processing speed
- [ ] Create risk scoring system based on security factors

## 4. Machine Learning Model Development
- [ ] Prepare training datasets from collected data
- [ ] Feature engineering for memecoin-specific patterns
- [ ] Implement and train Random Forest model
- [ ] Explore Reinforcement Learning approach
- [ ] Create model evaluation framework
- [ ] Implement backtesting system
- [ ] Optimize models for short timeframe predictions
- [ ] Integrate KOL transaction patterns as features
- [ ] Create anomaly detection system for market manipulation

## 5. Trading Strategy & Execution
- [ ] Design stratified trading strategies based on market cap tiers
- [ ] Implement risk management protocols (stop-loss, take-profit)
- [ ] Develop dynamic order sizing algorithm
- [ ] Create market condition monitoring system
- [ ] Implement trading pause mechanism during volatile conditions
- [ ] Build transaction execution module
- [ ] Integrate with Solana-compatible exchanges (Raydium, Jupiter)
- [ ] Test trading strategy with paper trading

## 6. User Interface & Visualization
- [ ] Design UI wireframes
- [ ] Set up web framework for dashboard
- [ ] Implement real-time portfolio monitoring
- [ ] Create trade history visualization
- [ ] Build performance metrics display:
  - [ ] Profitability
  - [ ] Win rate (target: 60%)
  - [ ] Prediction accuracy
  - [ ] Return on investment (ROI)
- [ ] Implement ML prediction confidence indicators
- [ ] Develop KOL and sniper bot transaction labeling
- [ ] Create manual override controls
- [ ] Implement secure authentication system
- [ ] Test UI responsiveness and functionality

## 7. Deployment & Security
- [ ] Set up secure API credential management
- [ ] Implement encryption for sensitive data
- [ ] Configure cloud environment for deployment
- [ ] Set up continuous operation monitoring
- [ ] Implement error handling and recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Create backup and restore procedures
- [ ] Perform security audit
- [ ] Deploy bot to production environment

## 8. Integration & Testing
- [ ] Integrate all components into unified system
- [ ] Perform end-to-end testing
- [ ] Conduct performance optimization
- [ ] Test with live market data
- [ ] Fix bugs and issues
- [ ] Validate against performance metrics:
  - [ ] Improve upon ~40% success rate of current call channels
  - [ ] Achieve target 60% win rate

## 9. Documentation & Deliverables
- [ ] Document code with comprehensive comments
- [ ] Create technical report on ML model
- [ ] Write deployment and operation guide
- [ ] Prepare final deliverables package
