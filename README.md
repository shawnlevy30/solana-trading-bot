```bash
python app.py
```

2. Access the web interface at `http://localhost:5000`

3. Configure your settings and start trading

## Components

### Data Collection

The data collection module fetches data from multiple sources including Dexscreener, Birdeye, and GeckoTerminal. It includes rate limiting, caching, and error handling to ensure reliable data collection.

### Timeframe Adaptability

The timeframe adaptability module automatically selects appropriate timeframes for analysis based on coin age, market cap, volatility, trend strength, and volume profiles.

### Data Pipeline

The data pipeline processes raw data into actionable metrics, including technical indicators, orderblock analysis, liquidity metrics, volume analysis, and security checks.

### Custom Filters

The custom filtering system evaluates coins based on multiple criteria:
- Market cap filters (size and FDV ratio)
- Liquidity requirements
- Volume thresholds and buy/sell ratios
- Technical indicator analysis
- Security red flags
- Orderblock support zones
- Age verification
- Price action patterns

### Security Audit

The security audit system analyzes potential risks in memecoin investments, including:
- Contract verification
- Honeypot detection
- Ownership analysis
- Tax assessment
- Liquidity lock verification
- Holder concentration analysis
- Transaction pattern analysis

### Machine Learning Model

The ML model uses Random Forest algorithms to predict price movements based on historical data, technical indicators, and market metrics.

### Trading Strategies

The bot implements multiple trading strategies:
- ML-Based Strategy: Uses machine learning predictions
- Orderblock Strategy: Identifies support and resistance levels
- Market Cap Tier Strategy: Applies different strategies based on market cap

### User Interface

The web-based user interface provides:
- Dashboard with portfolio overview
- Trading signals with confidence levels
- Token explorer with filtering
- Portfolio management
- Settings configuration

## Testing

Run the test suite to verify all components are working correctly:

```bash
